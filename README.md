Required Education 

To become a video game developer, nearly all of the developers have at least a bachelorâ€™s degree. Video game developers also need to have an amazing understanding in computer science, basic understanding of software creation, and know how to code in several programming languages. The developers need to attend post secondary for a four year degree course. Most well known companies mainly focus on what you have to offer instead of the school you graduated from. So creating your own projects to achieve your own accomplishment is an important step to create your own developer portfolio. Video game developers usually start from being coders and slowly being promoted to work on bigger projects.
