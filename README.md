# Careers in Computer Science

## 1.1 The Basics

### Job: Video Game Developer 

### **Description and Responsibilities**

A video game developer creates software and programs the logic of a game. Some of the stuff that they are responsible for creating are artificial intelligence in non-playable characters, the physics in the game/mechanics, and fixing code when it runs into problems.

## 1.2 Standard Education

### **University of Toronto Scarborough**

*Computer Science Co-op Program*

### **Entrance Requirements**
* Ontario secondary school diploma
* Six 4U/M courses
* Advanced Functions (MHF4U) (Calculus & Vectors (MCV4U), English (ENG4U)
* Supplemental Application Required
* Grade range of mid 90s

### **First Year Courses**

The courses that you would have to take first year are:
* ***CSCA08 - Introduction to Computer Science***

     Helps students learn about how to analyze and create simple   algorithms

* ***CSCA20 - Introduction to Programming***

     Helps students learn about basic programming techniques and tools. 

* ***CSCA48 - Introduction to Computer Science II***

     Continues teaching the general introduction with analyzing and creating algorithms with the focus  of software design, complexity analysis, and data structures.

* ***CSCA67 - Discrete Mathematics***

     Helps students learn about discrete mathematics that computer and mathematical science students require. 

* ***CSCB20 - Introduction to Databases and Web Applications***

     This course teaches students how to use tools and technologies so that they can advance with their programming skills and build stand-alone applications. 

It takes about 4 years to complete the co-op program.

### **Other Requirements**

* Successfully completing all prerequisite programs, or you will be removed 
* Co-requisite courses must be taken together
* If a course is an exclusion to the other, the credit will not be granted for both courses.

## 1.3 Experiential Learning

### **Ways to Obtain Valuable Experiences**

Co-op Programs 

Starting Own Projects 

Joining Clubs


Most well known companies mainly focus on what you have to offer instead of the school you graduated from. So creating your own projects to achieve your own accomplishment is an important step to create your own developer portfolio. Video game developers usually start from being coders and slowly being promoted to work on bigger projects.
